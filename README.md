# FoldingRoom
Creates a single-sheet pop-up page that can be exported to pdf, printed, and folded using the processing libraries for java.

Examples of the files it generates are bedroom.pdf and testroom.pdf. The page size is large because processing exports at 72 dpi and printing is done ideally at 300 dpi. If you print at 24% size it should print properly. After you print, cut along the red lines and fold along the dotted lines (mountain fold for dot-dash-dash and valley fold for simple dash). This creates a pop-up room as seen in bedroom.jpg. This is a minimal prototype and has a lot of features that need to be added.
